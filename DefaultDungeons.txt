Story
    Cube of Light Ark
        Background Info: 
            A Cube that used to hold all the powers of the world guarded by the chosen kings and their holy items. Eventually the people no longer live the right path 
            and has forced these kings to save them but only to be failed by their own people. A suppose to be peaceful annual meeting of all the kings has been averted
            by the death of their leader whose name is still unknown to this date.

        Region 1: --Master Roach--
            There was once a king who lived truthfully and served everyone of his kingdom. His people had no fear for whatever problem would come to them. The king worked 
            hard day and night, always serving his people. On the day that their leader died , Master Roach the king of the kingdom of Acedia lost the will to serve his
            people. His people demanded everything from him, housing, a good source of income and even his riches to which he always gave them. But on the day that their 
            beloved leader died he woke up from his dream of serving the people. He realized that his people does not see him as a king they see him as a money tree, shake
            him hard enough and money would fall from his branches. But no longer was he a fool, without their beloved leaders strict orders he saw no reason for him to 
            serve his people. The king that once did everything for his people now only appoints his servants to do his bidding. And should he be disturbed he shows no will
            in trying to help them, for he has grown tired of his people's wants and lazy to fill his people's needs

        Region 2: --Arme--
            **Lets no one in his kingdom, you are gonna have to work undercover to get the shard
            **basically thriving kingdom, can standalone but envies other kingdom after death envies them more 

        Region 3: --Behind you--
            **King lives among the people and no one notices his presence, continues his sht even after death of lead 
            **You have to be cautious on who you talk to or else the king wouldnt give you the shard 

        Region 4: --Gamadan--
            **Has a good kingdom but not better than other kingdoms still has some shortcomings, after the death of the lead assumes that he can lead more people to 
            greatness
            **Lenient in letting you in the kingdom but would not give the shard for it gives him "power"

        Region 5: --Orbtus--
            **Good kingdom rule, after death still good but likes to do trades that are better off for him with the kingdom of acedia in order to get more items 
            **Would not give you the shard and you have to take it by force. 

        Region 6: --Shenpai--
            **Semi-Good kingdom rule, after death felt like is no longer bound by the rules of the lead and roams the city undercover especially the red district
            **10/10 not really in the castle and wouldnt notice that shard was missing since his newfound power no longer gives him shard 

        Region 7: --Fall--
            **Good kingdom rule, after death looks for vengeance which puts his kingdom to a less fitting situation but has succesfully found the cause of death of the lead
            **Would give you the shard in return of accompanying him to where he pinpointed the spirit of the leader
